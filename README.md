This project proposes the development of an IoT-based Bidirectional Student Counting System, using the capabilities of the ESP8266 microcontroller and the Blynk application interface.
By utilizing infrared sensors strategically positioned at entry and exit points, the system detects the movement of students entering or leaving a classroom. 
The ESP8266 microcontroller processes the sensor data in real-time, allowing for the continuous updating of the student count. This bidirectional counting capability ensures that the system maintains count of the total number of students present within the classroom at any given time.
Using Blynk App the system is configured to display count and send notifications to user. Through the Blynk app, teachers, administrators, and other authorized users can remotely monitor count data in real-time.
